### 1. Machine Learning Algorithms

This is a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented using Python and NumPy from scratch. This is done to better understand these algorithms.

Each algorithm has its own Jupyter notebook, containing:

- Step-by-step code implementation
- Usage demonstration on datasets

**Algorithms included:**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Nearest Neighbor and K-Nearest Neighbors

### 2. Computer Vision

This section contains projects related to computer vision, primarily built using Python and Pytorch for deep learning.

**Projects included:**

- Image Clasification
- Object Detection
---

### 3. Papers Implementation

Implementations of various foundational neural networks for computer vision tasks.

**Papers implemented:**

- AlexNet
- VGG
- ResNet
- Unet
