# Implementations of papers

## Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition

[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)

Working implementation for resnet18 and resnet34.

## VERY DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS FOR LARGE-SCALE IMAGE RECOGNITION

[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)

Working implementation for all possible VGG models implementation.

## You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection

[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf)

as well as implementing appropriate metrics from scratch.

Work in progress
